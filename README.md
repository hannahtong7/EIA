# Ecological Impact Assessment of Two Hillsides in Lochranza, Isle of Arran, Scotland

## Project Overview

Human activities have significantly degraded ecosystems globally, leading to species decline and compromised ecosystem functions. This project conducts an **Ecological Impact Assessment (EIA)** of two hillsides in Lochranza, Isle of Arran, Scotland. By comparing biodiversity and habitat quality, the assessment aims to guide restoration efforts to improve ecological health.

This study revealed that:

-   **South Hillside**: Higher biodiversity and presence of priority species, including the critically endangered *Sorbus arranensis*. However, its bog exhibits low biodiversity, requiring targeted restoration.

-   **North Hillside**: Greater ecological degradation, with more invasive species and poorer water quality. Despite this, it supports unique nocturnal communities and higher vertebrate richness.

The EIA prioritizes restoring the South Hillside while addressing key issues on the North Hillside, such as invasive species management and water quality improvements.

## Project Objectives

1.  Compare biodiversity metrics (species richness, abundance, and distribution) across plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates.

2.  Assess habitat quality, focusing on priority and invasive species.

3.  Identify areas for restoration based on ecological value and degradation levels.

4.  Develop tailored restoration recommendations.

## Key Findings

-   **Priority Species**: South Hillside supports 8 Red List species, 10 Biodiversity Action Plan species, and 5 nationally scarce species. North Hillside hosts unique vertebrate species but fewer priority taxa.

-   **Invasive Species**: North Hillside has 9 invasive species versus 5 on the South Hillside. *Rhododendron ponticum*poses a significant threat to both areas.

-   **Water Quality**: Streams on the South Hillside exhibited "very clean" conditions (WQI: 9.1), whereas the North stream showed "clean" conditions (WQI: 5.8).

-   **Biodiversity Metrics**:

    -   South Hillside showed higher alpha diversity for terrestrial invertebrates.

    -   North Hillside exhibited higher nocturnal invertebrate and vertebrate richness.

## Restoration Recommendations

### South Hillside

-   **Rhododendron ponticum Removal**: Implement mechanical and herbicide methods to restore native woodland and protect *Sorbus arranensis*.

-   **Bog Restoration**: Rewetting to improve amphibian habitats and support pollinators.

-   **Wildflower Planting**: Enhance invertebrate diversity and ecosystem services.

-   **Bat Habitat Enhancement**: Install bat boxes and native hedgerows to increase roosting opportunities.

### North Hillside

-   **Invasive Species Management**: Prioritize removal of *Cotoneaster integrifolius* and *Epilobium ciliatum* to restore habitat integrity.

-   **Riparian Buffer Zones**: Improve stream water quality and habitat complexity by planting native vegetation.

-   **Grazing Management**: Reduce sheep grazing to promote vegetation recovery and enhance vertebrate habitats.

## Methodology

1.  **Desk-Based Survey**: Identification of priority and invasive species using GIS, UK National Biodiversity Network data, and NatureScot resources.

2.  **Phase I Habitat Survey**: Classification and mapping of vegetation and habitats.

3.  **Field Sampling**:

    -   **Invertebrates**: Sweep netting, light trapping, kick-net sampling for aquatic species.

    -   **Vertebrates**: Visual/audio surveys, camera traps, and passive acoustic monitoring for bats.

## Tools and Software

-   **GIS**: ArcGIS, QGIS for mapping study sites and habitat classifications.

-   **Data Analysis**: R with `vegan`, `rgbif`, and `ggplot2` packages for biodiversity indices and visualizations.

-   **Audio Analysis**: BatDetect2 for nocturnal vertebrate recordings.

## Results

-   Comprehensive biodiversity datasets, with alpha and beta diversity metrics for each taxa group.

-   Habitat maps highlighting dominant vegetation types and key ecological features.

-   Quantitative water quality indices (WQI, ASPT) for stream health assessment.

## Limitations

-   Limited sampling periods and accessibility constraints.

-   Temporal bias due to single-season data collection.

-   Taxonomic identification to order level for invertebrates reduced sensitivity.
