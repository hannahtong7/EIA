#All data compiled gives a more complete picture of the invertebrate communities on each hillside.
#Aims to provide a overall diversity and richness as a single metric, which may be more meaningful for restoration recommendations.
#Each method captures a different subset of the community (e.g., nocturnal, aquatic, terrestrial), and combining them helps capture the full spectrum of invertebrate diversity.
