#The bog is being analysed independently first to highlight its unique properties
#Calculating the biodiversity indicies as normal - without separating the two methods
#Bog was not initially combined with the invertrebrate sweepnetting and stream sampling due to slightly varying methods

#Bog was suspected to be ecologically distinct so analysed seperately - combining the data may have  obscure important findings about the bogâ€™s unique biodiversity.
#Knowing a habitats unique biodiversity in more detail can help further guide resotration decicions
